# Stand-project-sketch-app
Application to generate data for stand project sketch

The main task of the application is to collect information from the client and send it to the contractor.
In other words, the customer completes the parameters of the stand that he would like to commission.

Another task to be performed by the application is to save files with ready proposals for the client in the database.
In the future, an extended search engine is foreseen for the administrator so that he can match ready files to current queries.

The application can also be extended with the administrator's ability to manage the home page so that it becomes a showcase of the contractor.

The first registration is carried out by the administrator, in other words the company carrying out the order.
